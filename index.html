            <h2>About Cuphead</h2>
            <p>Cuphead is a modern game with sort of vintage style graphics, it will give you an impression that it's another fun and easy game but it's not actually as it looks like (you're gonna rage a lot). It's the story of two Cup brothers who gambled with the devil and lost their souls so they have to get back at him. Cuphead is all about fighting bosses on different islands, and buy new gear with coins you earn by playing some special levels called "run and gun". 
                It contains in total 3 main islands called Inkwell Isle one and two each one of them contains 5 boss levels and 2 run and gun levels, and Inkwell Isle three that contains 7 boss levels and 2 run and guns levels.
            The final island is called Inkwell Hell in contains a boss rush level and the final boss level.</p>
